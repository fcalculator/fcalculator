        <h2>How to Use the Mortgage Calculator</h2>
        <p>To use this mortgage calculator effectively, start by selecting your preferred currency from the dropdown menu. Then, enter the loan amount (the principal you plan to borrow), the annual interest rate as a percentage, and the loan term in years. Click the "Calculate" button to generate results. The tool will display your monthly payment, total payments over the term, and total interest paid. Below that, you'll see a detailed amortization schedule breaking down each payment into principal and interest components, along with the remaining balance. Interactive charts visualize the loan breakdown and balance trends over time. For record-keeping, export the results to PDF or share the page.</p>
        <p>This calculator assumes a fixed-rate mortgage with monthly payments. Adjustments for adjustable rates or other variables are not included; use it for initial planning and compare with lender quotes.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Mortgage Loans</h2>
        <p>A mortgage loan is a secured financing option used primarily to purchase real estate, where the property itself serves as collateral. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender can foreclose and sell the property to recover funds. Mortgages enable homeownership by spreading costs over long periods, typically 15 to 30 years, making them accessible for those without full upfront capital.</p>
        <p>Mortgages involve principal (the borrowed amount), interest (the cost of borrowing), and often additional fees like taxes or insurance. Payments are structured to gradually reduce the principal while covering interest, leading to equity buildup over time.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Types of Mortgages</h2>
        <p>Mortgages come in various forms to suit different needs:</p>
        <h3>Fixed-Rate Mortgage (FRM)</h3>
        <p>The interest rate remains constant throughout the term, providing predictable payments ideal for long-term stability.</p>
        <h3>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)</h3>
        <p>Starts with a lower fixed rate for an initial period, then adjusts based on market indices, potentially lowering or increasing payments.</p>
        <h3>Interest-Only Mortgage</h3>
        <p>Borrowers pay only interest for a set period, after which principal repayment begins, often resulting in higher later payments.</p>
        <h3>Reverse Mortgage</h3>
        <p>Available to seniors, allowing them to borrow against home equity without monthly repayments; the loan is settled upon sale or death.</p>
        <p>Choosing the right type depends on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Mortgage Payment Formula</h2>
        <p>The standard formula for calculating the monthly mortgage payment on a fixed-rate loan is derived from the principles of compound interest and annuities. It ensures that each payment covers both interest and principal, fully repaying the loan by the end of the term.</p>
        <p>\[ PMT = P \times \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \]</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\( PMT \): Monthly payment</li>
            <li>\( P \): Principal loan amount</li>
            <li>\( r \): Monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)</li>
            <li>\( n \): Total number of payments (loan term in years × 12)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, for a $300,000 loan at 4% annual interest over 30 years, \( r = 0.04 / 12 = 0.003333 \), \( n = 360 \), resulting in a monthly payment of approximately $1,432.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Amortization Explained</h2>
        <p>Amortization refers to the process of paying off a loan through scheduled payments that reduce the balance over time. In a mortgage amortization schedule, early payments primarily cover interest, while later ones focus more on principal reduction. This "front-loaded" interest structure means borrowers build equity slowly at first but accelerate toward the end.</p>
        <p>Here's a sample amortization table for a small loan to illustrate:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr><th>Month</th><th>Payment</th><th>Principal</th><th>Interest</th><th>Balance</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>$1,000</td><td>$200</td><td>$800</td><td>$99,800</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>$1,000</td><td>$210</td><td>$790</td><td>$99,590</td></tr>
                <!-- Additional rows for demonstration -->
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Extra payments can shorten the term and save on interest; use our tool to simulate scenarios.</p>

        <h2>Factors Influencing Your Mortgage Payments</h2>
        <p>Several elements affect your mortgage costs:</p>
        <h3>Interest Rates</h3>
        <p>Higher rates increase monthly payments and total interest; shop around for the best offers.</p>
        <h3>Loan Term</h3>
        <p>Longer terms reduce monthly amounts but raise overall interest; shorter terms save money long-term.</p>
        <h3>Down Payment and LTV Ratio</h3>
        <p>A larger down payment lowers the loan amount and may avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI).</p>
        <h3>Credit Score</h3>
        <p>Better scores secure lower rates; improve yours by paying debts on time.</p>
        <h3>Economic Conditions</h3>
        <p>Market rates fluctuate with inflation, federal policies, and lender costs.</p>
        <p>Consider these when budgeting for homeownership.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p><strong>What is the difference between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages?</strong> Fixed-rate offers stable payments, while adjustable-rate can change, potentially saving or costing more based on market trends.</p>
        <p><strong>How does a larger down payment affect my mortgage?</strong> It reduces the principal, lowers monthly payments, and may eliminate PMI, saving thousands over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I make extra payments on my mortgage?</strong> Yes, most allow it without penalty, reducing interest and shortening the term; check your lender's policy.</p>
        <p><strong>What if interest rates change after I start the loan?</strong> For fixed-rate, they stay the same; for ARM, payments adjust periodically.</p>
        <p><strong>How accurate is this calculator?</strong> It's based on standard formulas but estimates; actual terms depend on lender specifics and fees.</p>
