            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>FCalculator.com is designed to offer calculation tools without requiring user registration or the submission of personal identifiable information (PII). We do not collect or store any personal data from the inputs you provide in our calculators, such as financial figures in the Mortgage Calculator or health metrics in the BMI Calculator. All computations are performed client-side within your browser, ensuring that sensitive details remain on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.</p>
            <p>However, like many websites, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information through standard web technologies. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Details such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring pages, and timestamps of visits. This helps us analyze trends and improve site performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We use cookies to enhance user experience, remember preferences (e.g., currency selection in financial tools), and track site usage via analytics services. Cookies are small text files stored on your device. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Aggregated information on how users interact with our tools, such as popular calculators like the Compound Interest Growth Calculator or the Pythagorean Theorem Calculator, to refine our offerings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not link this non-personal data to any individual user.
