                <p>Daily Calories: <span id="calories" class="result-green"></span> - This represents your estimated total daily energy expenditure, adjusted for activity level and fitness goal. It's the amount of calories your body needs to support basic functions, movement, and achieve objectives like weight maintenance, loss, or gain.</p>
                <p>Protein (g): <span id="protein" class="result-green"></span> - Protein is a key macronutrient required in large amounts for building and repairing tissues, producing enzymes and hormones, and supporting immune function. Consume this amount daily from sources like meat, eggs, dairy, legumes, and nuts to promote muscle health and satiety.</p>
                <p>Carbs (g): <span id="carbs" class="result-green"></span> - Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy, fueling brain function, muscle activity, and overall vitality. This recommendation provides the grams needed for sustained energy, drawn from whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and other complex sources to avoid blood sugar spikes.</p>
                <p>Fat (g): <span id="fat" class="result-green"></span> - Fats are essential for cell growth, organ protection, hormone production, and absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Aim for this daily intake from healthy sources like avocados, oils, seeds, and fatty fish to maintain long-term health and energy balance.</p>

            <h2>What Are Macronutrients and Why Do They Matter?</h2>
            <p>Macronutrients, often referred to as "macros," are the primary nutrients your body requires in large amounts to function optimally. These include proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Each plays a critical role in energy production, muscle repair, hormone regulation, and overall health. Proteins support tissue growth and repair, carbohydrates provide quick energy for daily activities and workouts, while fats are essential for cell function and nutrient absorption.</p>
            <p>Balancing these macros is key to achieving specific fitness outcomes. For instance, higher protein intake can aid muscle building, while adjusted carb levels might enhance endurance. Our calculator uses evidence-based equations like the Mifflin-St Jeor formula for basal metabolic rate (BMR) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) to tailor recommendations to your lifestyle.</p>
            <p>Whether you're tracking for weight management or performance, understanding macros empowers better food choices. Link to our <a href="/bmi.html">BMI Calculator</a> for complementary body composition insights or <a href="/calorie.html">Calorie Calculator</a> for basic energy needs.</p>

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How the Macro Nutrient Calculator Works</h2>
            <p>This tool begins by calculating your BMR, the energy your body needs at rest. For accuracy, it optionally incorporates body fat percentage via the Katch-McArdle formula. Then, it factors in your activity level to determine TDEE. Finally, it adjusts calories based on your goal and distributes them into macros: typically 30% protein, 45% carbs, and 25% fats, with tweaks for loss or gain.</p>
            <p>Formulas used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor): Men = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age + 5; Women = -161 instead of +5.</li>
                <li>TDEE = BMR × activity multiplier.</li>
                <li>Macros: Protein ~1.6-2.2g/kg, fats 20-30% of calories, carbs remainder.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This approach ensures precise, sustainable results without guesswork.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of Tracking Macros</h2>
            <p>Tracking macros goes beyond calorie counting by ensuring nutrient balance. It can improve energy levels, support recovery from workouts, and promote long-term health. Studies show that personalized macro plans lead to better adherence and results compared to generic diets. For athletes, higher carbs enhance performance; for weight loss, increased protein preserves muscle mass.</p>
            <p>Integrate this with tools like our <a href="/tdee-calculator.html">TDEE Calculator</a> for comprehensive tracking.</p>
